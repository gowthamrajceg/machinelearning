# ML-Breast-Cancer-Python
Using scikit learn to diagnose breast cancer patients

This is a super simple project where I use Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and random forests to solve the simple problem
of diagnosing breast cancer patients.

# The Code

The code is written in Python 3. I have put plenty of comments so you should be able to go through the code without too much trouble.

The modules used are: 

-> Scikit Learn

-> matplotlib 

-> numpy

-> pandas

-> seaborn

The Dataset used is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set" that can be found at: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

The code is more for testing than anything else and for practice. But I hope that you find it useful.
If you do make sure to star/fork the repository.
